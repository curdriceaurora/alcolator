NSLocalizedString allows us to map multiple translations of a string based on the user's language settings/locale. It can be used on all strings but is preferred to be used on user facing strings. Only at runtime based on users preferred language the translation is in effect.  

It has two parts, the key and comment.  
Eg : NSLocalizedString(@"shot", @"singular shot")
"shot" is the key, the string to be translated
"singular shot" is the comment, provides context. Comment is not a mandatory field, but recommended when using with stringWithFormat for format strings with multiple substrings. 
When no localization preferences are included, then the key string is used as the translation. 


Subclassing

1. Primary objective is to abstract out properties and methods for reusability and extension as necessary. 
2. How to select what to absract out ? Conceptualize a hierarchial structure of classes that correspond to data/methods being designed such that data/methods that are common top down are included in the highest class and the ones that are particular to a sub class are included only at that level. 
3. Are variable/method values also handed down to subclass ? Yes but can be overriden with re-assignment
